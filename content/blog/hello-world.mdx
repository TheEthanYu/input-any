src/
  ├── components/
  │   ├── common/
  │   ├── layout/
  │   └── features/
  ├── lib/
  ├── hooks/
  └── pages/
```

### Performance Optimization

<Callout type="info">
  ShipOneDay comes with built-in performance optimizations, but here are some
  additional tips:
</Callout>

1. Use Image component for optimized images
2. Implement lazy loading for heavy components
3. Utilize edge caching when possible

## Common Patterns

### Data Fetching

```typescript
// Example of data fetching with error handling
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('/api/data')
    const data = await response.json()
    return data
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error)
    throw error
  }
}
```

### Component Composition

```typescript
// Example of component composition
function FeatureCard({ title, description, icon }) {
  return (
    <div className="p-6 border rounded-lg">
      {icon}
      <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">{title}</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-600">{description}</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```
